INSTALL for rdfind. By Paul Sundvall.
cvs version: $Revision: 566 $

To install rdfind:
rdfind needs the library nettle by Niels MÃ¶ller. 

If you alread have nettle installed properly and on a standard place, 
the installation goes quite smooth. Proceed to section 2 below.

1)
If you have nettle installed somewhere else (non-standard place, maybe
because you do not have root access), you have to supply the
paths to configure, for instance:
./configure CPPFLAGS=-I../nettle/  LDFLAGS=-L../nettle/nettle 

If you do not have nettle installed, you may install it either the
standard way (going to http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/,
downloading and installing after instructions found there), or 
with the small helper scripts in directory nettle provided with this
package. See the INSTALL file in that directory.

2)
compile rdfind with 
./configure (or ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I./nettle/  LDFLAGS=-L./nettle/nettle)
make
make install (optionally)

3)
rdfind should now work properly. Try man rdfind to check that the installation
was succesful.
